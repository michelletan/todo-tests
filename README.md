# Todo MVC Tests

**Test Application:** [Todo MVC](https://todomvc.com/examples/react/#/)

**Objective:** Design automated test cases for the following user stories using Robot Framework:

**User Story 1**
As a todo list user, I want to create a new todo list.
I should be able to mark the todo list as completed.
Then I should be able to delete the todo list.

**User Story 2**
As an automation tester, I want to test the performance of the todo list.
I need to create 20 todo lists with every test run.
Then perform test cleanup by deleting the 20 todo lists before exitting the test run.
